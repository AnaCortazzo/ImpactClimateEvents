# Health and economic impacts of climate events in the U.S.
This report presents the results obtained from the analysis of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) storm database. The objective of the analysis is to answer two questions:

 - Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

  - Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

In order to perform the analysis, a data processing was carried out, selecting those variables relevant to the study, and exploratory graphs were made to give us a clearer picture of the gravity of the climatic events for both health and the economy.

The results show that tornadoes are the most damaging climatic events for the health of the population, while floods cause the greatest economic damage.
